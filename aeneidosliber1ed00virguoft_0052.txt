48 VERGIL. AEN. I.

‘Neptune...took in by lot, ’twixt high and nether Jove
...the sea-girt isles'.

¹40· Vestras, Eure: domos, ‘home of thee and thine’. Vestras plu-
ral addressed to all the winds. So the Muses rx. 525 : Vos o Calliope.

aula, contemptuous. ‘let that be his proud court ‘.

¹⁴¹· clauso is emphatic: he had no business to open the prison:
‘King os the winds’ locked prison ’.

¹44· Cymothoe, a Nereid or nymph of the sea.

Tm'ton, one of the sea-gods z a familiar object with his shell—trurnpet
in mock—classical sountains.

1ι46; aperit, ‘opens’, i.e. a passage through. temperat ‘lulls',
‘ca ms .

¹47· Observe the sound subtly suggestive of the sost calm.

148—9. ‘And as when ost in a great mob arises riot, and the base
rabble grows wild'...

The simile is peculiar, being one of the few that compares the
greater to the less, a tumult among the supernatural powers to a human
disturbance. But no doubt there is a point in this apparent inversion.
The poet suggests that even a god stilling a storm may- be fitly
compared to the grand spectacle of one strong man mastering a mob.
He has the true Roman reverence sor order, the dignity and impressive
personality of the great man. See note on Similes, page 12.

The ‘seditio‘ was a common occurrence at Rome in the last century
of the Republic, and Vergil's picture would arouse many a memory
among his readers.

¹5¹· pietate ac merz'tz's, ‘virtue and good deeds’: pietas most
corresponds to ‘goodness’ of any Latin word: it is the faithfulness to
claims os gods and men: see 10.

155. caelo invectus aperto, ‘riding through the cloudless sky’.

156. dat lora, as we say ‘gives the rein ’.

secundo, lit. ‘following', i. e. ‘quick-gliding’.

curru, old dat.

[157—179. The Trojans run for Africa and seven ships reach safely
a sheltered bay.]

157. Aeneadae, ‘sons of Aeneas’ common for the ‘people’: so
‘children' is used in the Hebrew Scriptures. So, 560, they are called
Dardanidae.

160. efficit obiectu laterum, ‘makes a haven by its jutting sides’
(Papillon). The harbour is a poetical harbour, not a real place. The
comm. point out three passages in Hom. which V. may have had in his
mind.

162. ‚minantur in caelum, pregnant construction, ‘rise threatening
to heaven .

164. scaena...‘a background of waving woods and black forest of
grim shade, ἅθ’. scaena [Greek σκήνη, ‘tent’ or ‘booth’] is originally
the rustic theatre or stage, then the background or scene: so here used
by an easy metaphor sor a natural background.

166. fronte sub adversa, ‘beneath the cliss's face’, probably as C·
suggests at the head of the cove: but V. does not say so, since any diff
would be adversa as they drew to land under it.
