NOTES. 45

[50-75. She goes to Aeolus the wind· god who keeps the winds
prisoned in their cavern, and asks his aid, promising the nymph
Deiopeia as his reward. ]

52. Aeolia is Lipari, volcanie island to the N. of Sicily. ‘The
mighty rumbling of the mountain’ (55) common in a volcanie country,
might naturally* give rise to such my ths.

53. ‘struggling winds and roaring hurrieanes’. Observe the fine-
sounding unes 53, 55, 56.

58—9. ‘Else surely would they whirl off sea and land in their wild
course’. In prose we should have here ni faceret...fi’rrent‚ because it is
a present condition ulcere llze supposition is excluded by llze facts [he does
it: iflze did not do it, they w ould bear} The pres. subj. saczat treats the
question as still open, and m poetry is found for the other.

61. molem et memes, ‘the mass of mighty rocks', the two qualities
given in two substantives instead of one, what 15 called lzendz'adys (ἓν διὰ
&voum one by means of two ’.]

δι’ foedere certo, ‘by sure charter', foedus, Vergilian for ‘ law', ‘con-
dition .

63. premere, ‘tighten', laxas dare, ‘loosen’. V. is rather fond of
this periphrasis with dare: so 111. 69, placataque venti dant maria: 1x.
323, haec ego vasta dabo.

qui schel, subj. of purpose, common with qui: the purpose here is
the purpose of Iu ppiter who appoints him.

65. namque; the reason put fi1·‚st then the request, incute vim 69.

66. dedzt, ‘has allow’‚ed so 79, with inf.. common in poetry.
The verb follows the construction of verbs of permitting, sino, permz'tlo,
licet.

67. Zvrrlzetzzcrrz, Greek name sor ‘Tuscan ’ sea, i.e. between Sicily
and Ital .

68. yPenales are the whole of the powers who preside over the

- househ01d‚ whether any of the greater gods specially so worshipped, or

 

sacred images or relies.

69. submersas obrue, ‘sink and whelm’, accumulated expression in
Vergil’s manner: cf. conversa tulere, fixum sedet, sublapsa regferri, decep-
tam morte fefillil, &a

incute vim, ‘stir to fury’ ‘lash to fury', (C.).

73. Usually scanned conubio, the i being slurred into a y-sound
(cf. ariete, pariete, see note on 2): but Mr Munro, on Lucr.111. 776
gives reasons for believing it is conubio, the fi only being long in arsis
or the stress of the foot, as per conubia nostra, 1v. 316.

[76—80. Aeolus assents.]

76. explorare quid optes, ‘to search out thy will’: the only task of
the royal goddess is to interpret her own desires. This is the most
natural meaning. Quid optes may also be taken deliberative, ‘to search
out wlzat to wishfor' [so C. in trans. but differently in notes]: but the
other is more simple and natural.

78. quodcunque is only the modesty of courteous speech.

79. concilio, properly of persons, here extended to regnum and
sceptra. ‘This poor realm and my sceptre and the goodwill of Iove
thou winnest me'.
