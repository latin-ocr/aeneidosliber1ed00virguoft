NOTES. 63

544. iustior alter, the negative is omitted before the first clause : a
common device in all poetry.

546. si vescitur aura aetheria, ‘if he feeds on the air of heaven ', i.e.
if he breathes the air of heaven, a fine bold imaginative phrase for
‘living’ : aetherias auras being borrowed from Lucret.

Some comm. find fault with aetheria, properly the upper air: but
there are hundreds of places where ‘heaven' is used in English poetry
for the ‘air' by a similar freedom.

547. crudelibus umbris, ‘amid the cruel shades’, local abl.

548. non melus, ‘we have no fear’, like haud mora, est understood.

afficio, ‘kindness’.

certasse priorem, ‘wert first in the rivalry of service'‚ lit. ‘strove the
first‘.

[Some edd. H. W. G. disliking non metus: as abrupt, read ne for
nec, and make one sentence of it. ‘We sear not lest thou shouldst re-
gret, &c.' But there is no need to alter it.]

550. arma is the best-attested reading and probably means
‘strength ⁹, ‘fighting men ’. The sense is shewn by 557. ‘If we can’t
reach Italy, we can at least find a 5⁰st settlement in Sicily among
friends’. The easier reading arva is less well supported.

552· silvis aptare trabes, ·’ to fashion planks in the forests', rather un-
usual phraseology.

stringere remos, lit. ‘to strip oars’‚ i.e. to trim the boughs into oars.

554. ut—petamus is the purpose of subducere...aptare..stringere,
and si datur depends upon the uir-clause, though it comes first.

555. absumpta salus, ‘if our safety is clean gone’, emphatic phrase-
olo .

t(357. at, in the apodosis, like the Greek ἀλλὰ, means ‘at any rate ⁹,
and is used in earnest appeals.

Sicaniae. V. identifies Sicani and Siculi, and uses both names
indifferently of Sicily. According to Thuc. VI. 2, they were two
different races who migrated into the island at different times. The
quantity is either Sicania or Sicanus: the adjective is usually the latter,
the 4-syll. subst. the former ; for convenience.

559. fremebant, ‘applauded'.

[560-578, Dido replies: Fear not: Ι am forced to guard my
frontiers. We are not so far away as not to know your name.
VVhether you go or stay, Ι will do my best for you. If only Aeneas
were here ]

561. voltum demissa, ‘her face downcast’‚ see 228.

563. res dura, ‘hardship’.

564. talia moliri. ‘To this task‘, i.e. of watching the ports and
coast carefully. molior, see above, 414.

custode, collective, like milite, remzssga &³c.

565. nesciat, ‘who could be ignorant ’, potential.

Aeneadum (old gen. in -um), see note on 157.
567—8. ‘Not so dull our Punic wits, nor so far from our city does

the sun yoke his car’, i.e. we are not so ignorant nor so remote, as not
ἑο have heard of you: such irony is perhaps Vergil’s nearest approach to
umour.
