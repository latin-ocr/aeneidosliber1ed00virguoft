4² VERGJL AEN. L

3. Observe ille grammatically superfluous but vivid and emphatica
⁴ much wayworn he by land and sea &c’. So vn. 805, Camilla Bella-
trix, non illa colo, &c. xl. 492, campoque potitus aperto aut ille in pastus
armentaque tendit equarum. '

iactatus, properly os buffetings by sea, used by rather a stretch with
terris .· a sort of zeugma as it is called.

4. superum, [old form os gen. cf. deum, Danaum, Aeneadum.
caelicolum, &c.] ‘the gods': though Aeneas’ enemy is chiefly Iuno, all
the gods are interested in his wanderings.

5. ‘ Much stricken too in war, till he should build him a city, &c. ’
Dum expresses a purpose always with the subjunctive: though here it
is quite as much the purpose os sate as the purpose os Aeneas that
the poet means. The full sense is ‘enduring till the time should come
when, &e.’

6. Latinum...Albani...R0mae: we are told (265) Aeneas should
reign 3 years over Latium, then Ascanius his son should reign in
Lavinium 30 years, and after that transfer the seat to Alba (a sew miles
SE. of Rome). There the kingdom should last 300 years, when
Romulus should be born. ,

Observe that the first passage ends emphatically with Romae.
See 3.

8? quo numine laeso, ‘sor majesty how outraged’‚ i.e. ‘sor what
outrage to her majesty’. So qui, quis, aliquis are used poetically sor an
adverb, ι. 18¹, Anthea si quem...videat‚ i.e. if he can see Antheus any-
wlzere': 11. 81, fando aliquod si forte...nomen‚ ‘if the name at all has
come’. Pap. quotes aptly Cic. Rep. 1. 36: A Iove incipiendum putat
Quo Iove? i.e. ‘ why from Jove?’

9. volvere, ‘traverse' by an obvious metaphor.

ιο. pietate. ‘goodness’2 the regular epithet of Aeneas in the poem
is pius: he is represented as the man who to his father and people and
gods sulfils all righteousness.

ιι. impello is used by V. with inf. like many other verbs (hortor,
oro, luctor, ardeo, suadeo, &³a) which in prose naturally have ut with
sub'.

J‘In heavenly hearts can such wrath dwell?' a characteristic touch
of the poet’s gentle nature: with an undertone of sadness too, as though
violence and passions are to be looked sor on earth.

[iz—33. Iuno protectress os Carthage, mindful of the prophecy
that a Trojan race should destroy the African city, and wrathful sor
other reasons, prevented long the wandcrers from landing in Italy.]

η. Tyrii3 Carthage being a Phoenician colony, and Tyre being
one os the leading original Phoenician towns. So Siaimiau and Phoeni-
cian are used sor Carthaginian.

¹3· contra, ‘saeing’: i.e. on opposite shores os the great sea.
No doubt the long rivalry of the two is also in the poet's mind.

14. studiisque asperrima belli, ‘hardened in war’s rough arts'.

studia are properly ‘interests', what you are ‘busy’ with.

opum, gen. os respect, especially common with words os plenty,
aboundz'ngtplenus, (lives, abundans).

16. Samo.- at Samos (island off Asiatic coast os Archipelago) Iuno
