ΝΟ TES. 67

662. urit atrox Iuno, ⁸ Tuno’s wrath vexes her ’‚ i. e. ‚ the thought of it.

665. Typhoia. Typhoeus was a monster with 100 heads produced
by the Earth to revenge the death of the Titans whom Jove slew. But
Typhoeus himself was slain by another thunderbolt. So ‘tela thm'a'
means ‘bolts such as slew Typhoeus’, rather a stretch of meaning.

The sense is of course the supreme power of Love.

667. ut, ‘how’.

668. iactetnr: so ingreditur G. 111. 76, obruimur A. 11. 211, datsir
v. 284: [but it does not appear that this is one of the archaisms of
Ver il].

6g69. nota, poet. variauon sor the common nolum. In Greek it is
common ἀδύνατα, γνωτά, δεινά, πότερα.

671. ‘I sear whither may end this welcome of Iuno's'.

vertant, deliberative, lit. ‘whither it is to eml' like nescio quo eam,
⁰1 don't know whither to go': it might be simple indirect question
‘whither is turning', but the other is more natural.

Iunonia, Venus instead os saying, ‘Dido's welcome’ says naturally
‘Iuno's'. Iuno was her soe: she was planning all this delay at
Carthage: it is of Iuno she is thinking here, as cessabit shexxs.

672. ‘She will not be idle at such a turning-point of fortune'.

cardo (the socket in which the gate-post turns), osten used thus
figuratively, like English ‘to turn on ’, ‘turning-point ’.

674. ‘that no power may change her‘z another hint at Iuno.

675. mecum teneatur, ‘bound to me’, variation of phrase, literally
‘kept with tne’.

The other int. of mecum, ‘like rne‘ (pariter atque ego), is hardly
possible. A mother's love could not be compared by Vergil to the love
os man and woman. Venus wants to keep Dido in her party and
prevent her going over to tlte enemy: hence the siege-metaphor of 67 3.

676. qua, ‘how' adv. as 682.

678. mea maxima cura: hence she takes care that no harm shall
happen to him, 680.

679. pelago et flammis, either dat. after restantia ‘surviving’, like
{he dat. with superstes, superesse: or perhaps more likely abl. ‘saved
rom .

682. medius sor adv. as osten: ‘or come between ’.

683. non amplius, often used idiomatically thus, without changing
the case of the subst. So non plus quingentos, non amplius quadum·
millia assuunt, non amplius unum.

68 . laticem Lyaeum, ‘the ssow of wine ', Lyaeus (here used adj.) a
name os Bacchus.

f 688. fallasque veneno, ‘and poison unawares', fallere regularly used
o actm unseen.

the lulling os the divine slumber.

sleep being an act of divine power, see note on 256.

694.h d‘CJradles him in flowers, and wraps him in the breath of its
