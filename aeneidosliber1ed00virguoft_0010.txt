6 PRFFA TORV NOTE.

With the text there has not been much to do. Such differ-
ences as there are in the different copies, and they are not very
many, are mostly unimportant, and there is not generally much
difficulty in deciding which is the best reading.

Of the books which have been of use in the preparation of
this little edition, it is scarcely necessary to say that the late
Professor Conington's writings have been the most helpful. He
did so much in many ways sor the due understanding and ap-
preciation of Vergil, that it is obvious that every student must
bc under great obligation to him.

Bcsides these, the books of which 1 have made most use
are the following, to which my acknowlcdgments arc due:

Ribbeck's Vergil, 1860.
Gossrau's Aeneid, 1876.
Wagner's smaller edition, 1861.
Dr Kennedy's School Edition, 1876.
‚, Text (Pitt Press), 1876.
Stort·'s Aeneid. i. ii. Papillon's Vergil, Oxford, 1882.

Mr Morris’ translation of the Aeneid has been occasionally
quoted in the notes, such quotations being marked (M): also
Lee and Lonsdale’s‚ quoted with the sign (LL).

Lastly, 1 am glad to take this opportunity of expressing my
obligations to Professor Scllar's most interesting work on
Vergil (Oxsord, 1877), which not only is full of information
about the antecedents‚ aim, and character of the Aeneid, but
also contains much suggestive thought, and delicate insight into
the rare excellences of the poet.

'0' 11 has been thought better, in deserence to the unanimous opinion os scholam, to
employ the spelling Vergilius, Vergil, consistently all through.
