62 VERGIL. AEN I.

harmless shipwrecked men, bound for Italy. Why do the people so
illtreat us? Let us land and repair our ships, and sail to Italy, if
Aeneas yet lives z is not, we will settle with Acestes for our king-J

520. introgressi, verb, sunt being understood, 237.

521. maximus, ‘aged' sor the prose maximus natu. So 6 54 maxima
natarum, ‘eldest daughter’.

5²4· maria omnia vecti. Ace. os extension over: ‘wind-tost over
every sea'. So errare terras, aequora currere, &c.

526. propius aspice, ‘look more kindly’, opposed to averti. C.
suggests well ‘incline your ear’ as a parallel metaphorical expression.

527· penates, i.e. ‘the hoines’: properly the objects os household
reverence, mages, gods, relies, διε.

populare venimus, ‘we have come to ravage’, infinitive of purpose,
not a prose construction: but common in the comic poets after verbs os
motion (eo, venio, curro, millo, ξφα), and cf. Hor. pecus egit altos visere
montes : tradam portare, &a

l 5²8· ,Observe the vivid and rapid phrase ‘hurry the stolen booty to
ἱ le ἕξω ais, in its peculiar sense ‘violence ’.

There are two points : our nature is not disposed to violence: and if
it were, our troubles make us humble.

530. Hesperia (from ’Ἕσπερος ‘evening star’) ‘the western land'
Greek name sor Italy. ἢ

53²- Oenolri, old Italian race, settled originally in south of Lucania
and Bruttium, whence the name Oenotria was used as one of the poetic
names sor Italy. Oenotria is no doubt ‘the Wine-land‘. Vergil here
speaks as though Oenotri were once all over Italy: but this is poetic
vagueness.

533. ducis, Italus, a legendary hero invented from Italia, a name
which really is connected with vitulus and means ‘the Cattle-land‘.

534. lzic cursus fuit, ‘this was our course', attraction from adverb
to pronoun, = ‘thither lay our course'. So hunc cursum lv. 46.

535. adsurgens fluctu nimbosus, ‘rising with storm and swell’.
Orion was osten called a ‘stormy’ constellation [aquosus lv. 52, saevus
vu. 719, pronus tumultu Hor. Od. 111. 7, 18] but always in connexion
with his selling (at sum-ise) which took place from end Oct. to end N ov.
and so coincided with the naturally stormy season. Vergil is defended
here on the ground that this is summer (septima aestas, last line of
book 1) and that Orion does rl'se in summer. But unfortunately he is
not then ‘st01·my’: and the probability is that V.'s astronomy is loose
and imaginative as osten with the poets; he uses Orion sor a stormy
constellation. and does not stop to think whether it is the setting or the
rising, whether suminer or winter.

5 36. penitus, ‘sar'‚ 512, procax ‘boisterous '‚ lit. wgent, troublesome,
connected with preces, precari, procus.

539. ‘ What is this land so savage that suffers such custom?'

543. ‘Yet look for gods who forget not the Right and Wrong’, a
stately and impressive warning. with rich and unusual diction. aster V.'s
manner. Sperate‚ rare sor ‘expect': sandi, nefandi. lit. ‘speakable and
unspeakable', so harmless, innocent, right, and horrible, evil, wrong.

So Catull. 52, 406,sanda nefanda: and the common dicenda tacenda.
