No TES. 55

3¹0· convexo nemorum must be ‘a creek o'erarched with wood’.

3¹²- uno comitatus Achate. The abl. is not instrumental, but is a
strained use os the abl. of attendant circumstances. we may perhaps
say that comitatus supplies the place oscum. In English we do exactly
the same when we say accompanied with’ instead of‘ accompanied by’.

So lx. 48, viginti lectis comitatus. In 11. 580, Iliadum turba et
Pluygiis comitata ministris, the way being prepared by the clearly
instrumental turba we had better take ministris also instrumental-

3¹4· sese lzclz't obvia, a common Vergilian variation from obviam.
So 11. 388 ostendit se dextra, 408 sese iniecit periturus.

316. Threissa, Greek sem. adj. for Thracia, Thracian.

Spartanae, because the Spartan maidens were practised in gymnastic
traiuincr.

3¹ 7b blfzrpalyce, daughter of a Thracian king and a famous huntress.

pr'aevertztur, ‘outstrips’: the accusative is due to the tlansitive
meaning which the word acquires, as happens with so many verbs: e. g.
vim viribus exzt; mstabant cunum, socios circumtulit unda, pmefatus
szvos arma treszscunt &a So erumpere nubem, 580.

Hebrus, the Maritza‚ of old a famous river of Thrace.

3¹9· dzffundere, ‘to scatter'‚ infinitive of the purpose, (or epea-(gretie
as it is called,) Greek idiom, like ἔδωκε λαβεῖν, λεῖπε φορῆναι.

320. sinus collecta, ‘her folds gathered', construction explained in
note on 228.

323—4. K. following Madvig reads here maculoso, in order to take
the line quite differently:...‘wandering here girt with quiver, and
chasing with shouts a lynx os spottca' lzz’de [lyncis governed by cursum
instead of tegmine] or a foaming boar ⁷. This is ingenious, as it couples
lyncis and apri together, which is plausible. But the common trans-
lation ‘girt with a quiver and spotted lynx—skin’ is quite unobjection-
able : there is no trace of the reading maculoso in any book : and above
all tegmen is more naturally the hide of the dead beast.

326. mihi, dat. of the agent aster past participles: common in
Augustans in imitation of Greek dat. after perfect passive. So VI. 509
nihil o tibi amice relictum: V111. 169, quam petitis iuncta est mz‘lzi
dextra. So perhaps similarly with pres. 440, cernitur ulli.

3¹27. memorem, stately word for ‘canu

3²8· hominem sonat, ‘sounds mortal’‚ hominem being accus. sub-
stitulcd sor cognate: so agere ‘to act' has acc. of the part acted : saltare
puellam (Ov.), saltare Cyclopa (Hor.) and demorsos sapit ungues ‘tastes
of the bitten nail’, i. e. of laborious composition.

3 3ο felzx, by transferred sense, ‘kind⁷, ‘propitious'. So felix
Ιιοςέία, filex omen, felzx faustumque szt, sis bonus o felixque, Ecl
V ὓ·

G 33¹· tandem, common in questions, like δή in Greek or dcun in
erman.

33²- iactemur, ind. quest. doceas iussive.

Observe locorumque with an extra syllable elided before the vowel of
the next line, so 448.
