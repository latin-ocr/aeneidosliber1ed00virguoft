44 VERGIL. AEN. J.

3¹· mullos.- it was seven years: iam septima ponat...aestas, 1. 755.
septima post Troiae excidium vertitur aestas, v. 626.

33. ‘So vast a work it was to found the race of Rome’: the
keynote os the Aeneid (the destiny of Rome) struck at the close os the
Exordium or opening passage, just as the first passage os the poet-
philosopher Lucretius ends with the bitter and powersul line, Tantum
religio potmt suadere malorum.

molis, possessive gen like sapl'entzae est, virtutis est, ‘it belongs to’,
‘is a part os’, ‘requir'es. The word means ‘mass’, ‘weight' and so is
used (like molzor, see 4¹4) of‘ effort‘.

·[34—49. The Troj an fleet leaves Sicily. Iuno nursing her wrath
exclaiffiis ‘shall the othJer gods defeat their foes aud Ι the wife of Jove
be ba ed?

34. Thle poet avoids preface and plunges into the midst of the
events. The foregoing events from the sack os Troy to the voyage from
Sicily are told by Aeneas in books 11. and 111. Siculus, ‘Sicilian’z see
note on 557.

35. ruebant, ‘were ploughing’. In 85 the word is used of ‘up-
heaving' water with wind: xx. 211, of ‘raking' or ‘sweeping’ bones
and ashes from the pyre: G. 1. 105, of ‘levelling‘ ridges: the general
idea seems to be nothing more precise than ‘violent movement. '

37. mene. desistere, cs. 97, ‘I to leave my purpose baffledl’ The
ins. of indignant exclamation. So in English we say ‘to think that’
and' in Greek σοῦ τὸ μὴ φράσαι ι(1116 idea os) your not telling ruel’

38. Teucri, ‘Trojans' siom Teucer, mythical first king of lroy, son
of lrojan river Scamander and a nymph.

39. quzsppe vetor sales, ‘doubtless the sates forbid me'. quippe
like so many particles of ffr malton can easily be ironical, as here.

40. The most complete version of this story (which varies much) is
that Aiax loved Cassandra and tried to drag her off from the temple of
Minerva (11. 404). The goddess was angry, and wrecked the Greek
{leet on their return at Caphereus in Euboea, and slew Aiax. Hoiuer‘s
story is rather different, aud makes Poseidon slay the offender.

zpsos, the men, opposed to the ships.

4¹· furias, ‘srenzy't for iuipious boldness was regarded as a kind os
madness. Oili, ‘son of Oileus⁷: sor form see ‘Achilla 30

4²- ipsa, ‘hersels‘, because it was Iuppiter who properly handled
the bohs, and she was usurpiug.

44—5. Notice the soree: ‘Gaspiug out fire from his pierced
breast, she caught up in the whirlwind aud impaled 011 a point of rock’.

46. incedo, ‘who step forth queen of gods‘, describing the majestic
gait of the goddess· a peculiarly Latin and dig nisied word. So 405, vera
incessu patuit dea: and 497.

49. praeterea,‘ any more‘ : so Eurydice, Georg. lv. 500, neque illum

raeterea vidit.
p zmponet, the fut„ is rather odd aster the pres.. but it is the best· -sup·
ported reading.

honorem, ‘homage'‚ i. e. ‘saerificefi honos is a favourite uord of
Vergil, andis used sor a great variety of things: hymn, funeral, reward,
beauty, leaves, sacrifice, &c.
