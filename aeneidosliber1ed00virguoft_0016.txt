Note on the Similes.
The following are the similes in this book :—

(1) Line 148 Neptune stills the tempest as a great and good
man stills a sedition by look and word.

(2) ,‚ 430 The busy toil of building Carthage like the busy
toil of a beehive.

(3) ,‚ 497 Dido comes to the temple, like Diana on the
hills.

(4l ‚‚ 592 Venus adds beauty to Aeneas, as the artist to
ivory, silver‚ or marble.

In studying these similes we see at once what they add to
the poem in the way of ornament or picturesque suggestiveness.
The fourth simile excepted‚ which is given in a passing touch,
and not elaborated‚ the rest are all of them beautiful or im-
pressive pictures. Ι

But in most of these similes the point qf tlte comparison is '
more or less obvious: a god stilling a storm like a man stilling
a tumult (1): the active life of a city like the active life of a
hive (2): a beautiful woman advancing like a beautiful goddess (3).

The resemblances are such as easily occur to anyone's mind:
the thing compared is prominent, it lies on the surface: the
simile is an ornament rather than a true illustration. The art
is shewn in the workmanship rather than in the choice of the
comparison: in the vividness‚ beauty, and the truth of its
details.

And we must also observe that the details have often no
bearing on the comparison. For example in (1) the great citizen
is ‘reverend sor worth and service'-—not much like the relation
of Neptune to the waves! The riot is stilled by his look,
whereas Neptune chides the winds roundly.

So in (2) the details of the hive bear no resemblance
(naturally) to the details of the city life: there is nothing in
the Carthage-description corresponding to ‘leading out the
young’ or ‘packing the honey' or ‘driving away the drones’.
In (4) even the main point of the comparison is a little obscure
and inappropriate: the goddess shedding beauty on the hero
