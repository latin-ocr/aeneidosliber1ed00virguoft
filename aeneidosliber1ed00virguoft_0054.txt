he could lay low, &c- We might give it in English thus: ‘nor stays
his hand till he can lay low in triumph’..

195. deinde displaced, as it is occasionally· it belongs to the verb
di‘vidzt. So 111. 609,q uae deinde agitet fortuna fateri, ἰ. e. deinde fateri
quae. .: and sic dez'ndeq effatus, sic deinde locutus.

cadis onerare, variation for the ordinary onerare cados vino. So
Burns, ‘give to me a pint of wine and fill it in a silver tassie’. Vergil is
very fond os such variations.

196. Trinacrio, ‘Sicilian‘: the island was called Trinacris, ac-
cording to the ancients from its three promontories. So Ovid z

Terra tribus scopulis vastum procurrit in aequor,
Trinacris, a positu nomen adepta loci.

But it may be a corruption os the Homeric Θρινακίῃ, which has
nothing to do with three promontories.

198. ante, ‘ere now' ,quite correct with the present sumus, because
the sense is‘ we have known ere now' 'the knowledge continues in the
present. Of course it cannot go with malorum ιιι the sense of‘ previous
ills', as some comm. suggest. That would neither be Latin, nor suit
the ’Homeric line from which this· ι5 imitated: οὐ γάρ πώ τι κακῶν ἀδαή-
μονές ἐσμεν.

ι99. Notice the strange pathos and beauty of this wonderful line.

200. Scylla was the barking monster (localised by legend in the
stiaits os Messina) mentioned m the Ody y-ssey

201. αεῑειίις, contracted sor metre' 5 sake stom accessisti& Α

So V uses vexet, traxe, extinxtz‚ and other poets consumpse, pro·
misse, despexe. T hese contractions are all of the same kind.

Cyclopea saxa, ‘the caves of Cyelops'‚ the one· eyed monster whom
Ulysses blinded, according to the Odyssey, in his cave near Aetna.

203 mvabit, V.1sinntat1ng Homer, τῶνδε μνήσεσθαι ὀΐω, Od.x11.
212, but as so oft’en is the case refines upon him.

[208— 22 2. They feast and talk and bewail the lost.]

209. premit altum corde, adjective adverbial as osten, ‘keeps
sorrow deep in his heait’.

21 1. viscera, ‘’ssesh: all below the skin is viscera.

214. victu revocant vzres, ‘resresh their strength with sood': V. is
fond of the alliteration with v's.

2¹ 5. inplentur, reflexive or middle, ‘take their fill’, prob. in imita-
tion of the Greek. So imponere, ‘take thy seat’ 11. 707: insternor pelle,
⁴1 spread my shoulders with a skin' ιι. 722: cingor ‘1 gird mysels’,
11. 74 &c.

ΒέαΙιὶ,ι ‘wine’ .the god for the product, as Cererem, 177.

217. requzrunt, pretty word for‘ regret‘, ‘filament

218. seu poetically used for utrum or num: so ‘erravitne via seu
lassa resedit incertum’ ιι. 739.

credant, delib. ‘they are to think '.

219. extrema pati, ‘are in their last agony'. Observe the
characteristic pathos os this line.

220. Oronti, gen. from Orontes, cf. 30.

222. The repetition of fortem is not weak, as some think: it gives
a kind of formal stateliness ; they are a people 01 heroes.
