top of the' hill! It is rather an oversight in the poet’s description:
more especially as it hardly harmonises with 507, where Dido is repre-
sented as doing justice, like a true queen of heroic times.

430. For the simile see Introduction, page 12. It is taken in the
main from Georg. 1v. 162, sqq.

431. exercet, ‘presses on', i.e. ‘makes busy’.

432. liquentia, ‘liquid ’, part. of liquor. liqueo which makes also
liquens has the i short.

433. stzjant, ‘pack’z the notion of puslu'ng and tzglztness being
given in the very sound of the heavy overhanging spondee.

436. fervet opus, lit. ‘the work is hot ’, i.e. ‘all is busy toil'.

4 37. Aeneas the wanderer envies the settlers.

440. miscet, se.

cernitur ulli, ‘is visible to any ’, a poetic but natural variation for the
strict ab ullo. So videor regularly with dat.

[441—493. In a grove on a sacred spot Dido was building a tem-
ple to Iuno, Aeneas sees earved the tale of Troy, and is deeply touched.
The fighting: the tent of Rhesus: Troilus, the Trojan women, the dead
Hector: himself, and Memnon and Penthesilea]

441. laetissimus, ‘rich’‚ of fertility as often. So Georg. 1. 1, quid faeiat
laetas segetes. This makes the gen. umbrae easy and natural: the abl.
of most MSS. is due very likely to misunderstanding laetissimus, and
taking it in its common sense ‘glad'.

442. quo with loco.

444. acris, lit. ‘spirited', i.e. a ‘war horse': which explains the
use os this adjective of a dead horse, a use which some have objected
to as meaningless.

445. facilem victu, ‘ rich in substance', Iit. ‘easy in living’, i.e.
their sood was easy to get: an instance os the transferred epithet.

447. numine, the ‘favour’ or ‘presence’ of the goddess.

448. Observe the emphasis on aerea, aere, aenis.

nexaeque, que hangs over as it does in 3 3²·

There is another reading nixae ‘testing on ’ζ the two words are osten
confused in MSS. But it is unlikely the pz'llars would be brass: and the
MSS. authority is far stronger sor nexae.

450. ‘a new sight met him and calmed his fear'.

454. quae...771iratur‚ ‘marvels at the city's fortune’: the quae...st't
clause being rather indirect exclamation than indirect question. Aeneas
said: ‘what a fortune the city has!’ not ‘what fortune has the cityP'
So x. 20: Cernis ut insultent Rutuli, ‘thou seest how they insult’, and
below 466, videbat uti...sugerent.

455. inter se, ‘the rival· skill' (C.), lit. ‘the skill [hands] of the
artists amongst themselves '‚ i. e. ‘as compared with one another'. C.⁷s
translation is very neat, and probably right, though the phrase is so
strained as to have given rise to various readings and interpretations:
e.g. intra se ‘within himself ', K. Madv. intrans, Rib. nitidas! Weid.

458. Atridae were Agamemnon and Menelaus, leaders of the Greek
host, sons of Atreus.

Priamus, king of Troy.

ambobus, both friends and foesg friends because Agamemnon took
