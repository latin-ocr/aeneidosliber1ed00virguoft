The more such similes are studied‚ the richer light is thrown
on the comparison: they are not, like VergiI's, poetic miniature
pictures to be enjoyed independently ; they are profound lu-
minous resemblances, a permanent addition to our fancy and
insight, sor which we are grateful to the higher gists of the
poet.

l have said so much, to make it clear, that what Vergil aims
at in his similes is something quite different (and in one sense
sar less) than what the modern poet (especially the lyric poet)
aspires to: sor in order to appreciate the true poetic success of
Vergil, it is clearly necessary to understand his object, and so
avoid the mistake of judging him by an erroneous standard.

Note on the First Book.

The First book, though not equal in interest to the tragedy of
Dido's death in the Fourth‚ nor the splendid vision of the lower
realms, the meeting with Anchises, and the glories of Rome to “

books of this beautiful poem.

Besides the stately exordium with the true Roman ring about
the closing line

‘So hard a work was it to build the race of Rome‚'

we have the fine description of the storin, and the quieting of
the storm : and though in the remainder of the book there is not

are many beautiful and effective passages. Among these are
the prophecy by Ι uppiter of the future fate of Rome: the vision
of Venus as a Tyrian maid, ancl her son’s recognition of her as
she departed: the very beautiful passage about the carving of
the Trojan story on Iuno's temple, and Aeneas' feelings as he
saw it: the parting of the cloud and the fine outburst os thanks
to Dido uttered by Aeneas: and finally the idea os the sub-
stitution of the God of Love for Ascanius, and all the details
with which it is so powerfully and beautifully worked out,
preparing us for the disastrous love and the tragedy of Book IV.

And apart from the main beauties of conception and de-
scription in Vergil, there is another and more peculiar quality
which only the greatest masters possess: and that is the art by
