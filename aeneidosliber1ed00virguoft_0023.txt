literary men, and which indeed could not fail to be held by
them. With us, literary productioris belong indeed mostly to
one or other main class, and so far are composed under condi-
tions which prescribe the form ε though even here constantly new
varieties are invented: but both in style and subject-matter, the
aim of all great writers is to be original. The Roman literature
on the other hand was mainly formed on Greek models ; and to
adhere to those models closely, to be constantly reminding the
readers of them, to imitate them much in the treatment, in
the phraseology‚ and even in the incident, was inevitable to the
Latin poets3 or, rather, it was one of the very things they pro-
posed to do in writing1. Vergil’s style, indeed, is completely his
own, and entirely unlike Homer’s, as is plain from what has been
said; his main purpose and subject are entirely his own, and
truly Roman ; he borrows where he does borrow (and that from
Ennius, Cyclic poets‚ Greek tragedians, and many others besides
Homer) always to suit his own purpose, and not in a servile
mannen and he invariably remains master of his materials‚ and
stamps his own mark indelibly upon them.

But to understand Vergil, it is clearly necessary to grasp
the conditions under which he worked3 and nothing can be a
greater mistake than to feel surprise at the extent to which he
was indebted to his predecessors in the poetic art.

Om‘lz'ne of Vergil’s li e.

P. Vergilius Maro was born 15 Oct.‚ B.C. 70, near Mantua,
a town on the Mincio in North Italy, then called Cisalpine
Gaul. He had not good health, and after being educated at
Cremona and Mediolanum (Milan), and studying Greek and
philosophy elsewhere, he came back to live (probably) on his
father’s sarm, until about B.C. 42. In that year Octavianus,
afterwards the emperor Augustus, had defeated at Philippi
Brutus and Cassius, the murderers of Julius Caesar; and gave
lands to his victorious soldiers in various parts of Italy,
