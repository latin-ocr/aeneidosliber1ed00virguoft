16 INTRODUCTION

are often quoted as examples of such incompleteness. On some,
like 560, not much stress can be laid, as the broken line ends
the passage, and sometimes (in some other instances not in this
book) seems to end it even more effectively than a complete line
would: as for example in disce omnes, 11. 66: inimicaque Troiae -
numina magna deum, 11. 6223 the abruptness seems to add to
the rhetorical effectiveness. Others, like 534, hic cursus ficit,
have no such justification and are plainly unfinished passages.
And generally we may say that it is reasonable to doubt whether
if the poet had had the time he wished to complete the work, he

would not have altered most of these lines.

Note on Vergil’s peculiarily of szsj'le.

The object of style in literature, apart from the subject-.
matter, is to produce effect by successful choice of words.
Sometimes the effect is produced by using the simplest words
and phrases to express the idea: sometimes by the use of rare
or choice words, unusual turns of phrase, stretches of meaning,
or even stretches of grammar. The first we may call the
simple, the second the elaborate or artificial style. It is useless
to ask which is the best : each will suit best in turn the genius of
certain writers, the subject of certain poem, certain situations
or ideas, and the taste of certain readers: many pocts will use
them both at different times: and both may be most effective
in⁴⁸the hand of a master. And each too has its danger: the
simple is liable to fall into bathos and commonplace: the ela·
borate has a tendency to become turgid, stilted, over-artificial.

Take as an instance of the simple style the well-known line
of Wordsworth :—

“Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.”
Or this from Milton's Chris-tvans Ode>—

“And kings sate still with awful eye,
As if they surely knew their sovran lord was by.¹’
