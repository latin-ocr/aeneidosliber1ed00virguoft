66 VERGIL. AEN. J.

630. ‘sunt' understood as often.

‘Wrought coverlets there are, and os proud purple: massive silver
on the boards, and carved in gold the brave deeds os their sires, a long
{ine pf noble exploits, from the ancient rise of the race through many a

ero . ·

[643—656. Aeneas sends sor Ascanius and bids him bring giits.]

643. consislev‘e, ‘to rest ³.

644. rapidum, poetic adj. for adv. as so often: here it is even more
convenient, as the adv. is wanted for Achates not sor Aeneas, and
rapide would be ambiguous.

645. strat, oblique jussive, depending on praemittit, lit. ‘sends
him, let him tell ’‚ i.e. sends him sorward bidding lzz'm tell.

646. in Ascanio stat, ‘cleaves to Ascanius'. Stat implies ‘firmly
rooted’.

648. palla, a long dress worn by women reaching to the seet-

650. eirgivae...llh‘cc⁷zz's. Mycenae and Argos were two towns
some miles off one another, but in the poets both are spoken of as the
home os Agamemnon, and Menelaus the husband of Helen. In
Homer, Agamemnon is king of Mycenae and Menelaus of Sparta. In
Aeschylus they are joint kings os Argos.

651. ngama, Troy.

The ‘forbidden marriage’ is meant sor Paris who carried her off
from Greece to Troy, and so caused the Trojan war. (peterit old

uantit .) ‘

q 652.y Leda was the mother (by Iuppiter) of Helen and Clytaem-
nestra.

655. bacatum, ‘beaded ’.

duplicem gemmis auroque coronam: ‘double circlet of gold and
jewels' is what he means: but the construction is ‘circlet double
with gold and jewels’, a Vergilian variation, like virgulta sonantia
lauro.

duplicem must mean that there are two rings of gold fastened
to ether.

g[657—694. Venus plans to send Cupid instead of Ascanius, and
entreats her son to carry out the plan, and so to inssame Dido with love
sor Aeneas. Ascanius shall be hidden far away, in sleep: Cupid agrees]

658. Cupido, the son of Venus.

faciem mutatus et ora, either middle ‘changing his form and feature’
or passive ‘his form and feature changed’ (see πῶς the latter is more
probable, as Venus does it for him, not he for himself.

659. furentem, the result of the verb (proleptic): ‘kindle to mad-
ness’.

661. ‘Surely she fears the treacherous house, the double-tongued
T yrians’. The ‘faithlessness’ os the Carthaginians was a common
slander among the Roman writers: Livy accuses Hannibal os ‘perfidia
plusquam Punica‘. So Vergil makes the brother Pygmalion a base
traitor (346) : and Venus attributes Dido's welcome to craft (670).

The thought in bilingues (as in the English ‘double-tongued') is
probably the old superstition that the snake had two tongues. (Cf. the
old song, ‘ye spotted snakes with double longue'.)
