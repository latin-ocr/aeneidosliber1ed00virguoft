54 VERGJL. AEN. J.

The Caesar here is clearly Augustus, as is shewn by ‘289 and 294.
His sull name was Caius Iulius Caesar Octavianus Augustus.

289. spoliis· Orientis onustum, ‘laden with the spoils of the East'‚
refers to the great battle of Actium, where he triumphed over 'Antony‚
and won back the East (Egypt, Asia Minor, Syria, &c ) in B.c. 31.

‘²90- accipies secura, ‘shalt welcome and put away thy fears’.
That is : Augustus shall be deified and worshipped no less (hic quoque)
than your son Aeneas.

292. cana in its usual sense of ‘hoary’ and so ‘ancient'2 Faith
belongs to the good old simple days.

Quirinus, the divine name of Romulus. The whole passage is a
compliment to the Emperor whose religious revival is referred to
Introd. . .

293.p ‘9I'he Gates of War, grim with close fastenings of iron', are of
course the gates of Ianus, which were open in war time and shut in
time of peace. They were only shut three times in Roman history, the
third occasion being after Actium. The original notion was no doubt to
throw open the gates when the army marched out, in a formal way.

‘²94- Furor imputs, ‘accursed rage’, is Civil NVar. which had raged
sor 100 years when Augustus ended it.

Cicero quotes from Pliny an account of a picture (placed by Augustus
in the forum) by Apelles, the great Greek painter, of XVar a prisoner,
with his hands tied behind him, bound to the car of Alexander. The
idea was quite different from this: but possibly it may have suggested
the detail centum vinctus, ὅτ’ῑ.

[297—304. Mercury sent to dispose the Carthaginians to welcome
the strangers.]

297. Maia genitum, Mercurius, the messenger of the Gods.

298. novae agrees with Karthaginis probably, see 366.

299. hospitio, dative of purpose, or work contemplated; ‘to
welcome': see excidio line 22.

Noticefalz' nescia, involving a eurious idea of destiny, as though it
might have been thwarted by Dido's ignorance had not Iuppiter himself
inter osed.

350. arceret, irregular sequence with pateant, but easily explained
by the circumstances :pateant describes the order which Mercury was to
give, in arceret he goes back to the malive sor that order. And the
difference in tense helps to keep them distinct: both tenses being strictly
possible with the historic present.

30¹· ‘the oarage of wings’, a sine image borrowed by many poets
from Aesch. Ag. 52, πτερύγων ἐρετμοῖσιν ἐρεσσόμενοι.

[305—334. Aeneas goes out to explore, and meeting his mother
Venus, dressed as a maiden, asks her where they are and promises
offerings to her shrine, as to a goddess]

307. accesserit, subj. os indirect quest„ see Sclieme.

307—9. We might take explet-cve with lacos, and quaerere with the
subordinate clauses: but more probably in the poet⁷s mind explorare
goes with both, and quaerere is a mere repetition sor clearness in the
long sentence.

309. exacta referre, ‘bring back word’. exacta is simply ‘the end’
of his toil, i.e. the fruit, the tidings.
