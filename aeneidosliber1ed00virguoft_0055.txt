NOTES. 51

[22 3-2 53. Iuppiter looks down from heaven on Africa, and Venus
with tears complains that the promises made to her Trojans are
unsulfilled. Antenor was allowed to escape the Greeks and settle
peacefully in Italy: the chosen hero and his comrades are driven
awa .

izi. The pretty word velivolum, applied by Lucr. to a ship, V. still
more exquisitely applies to the sea: ‘ the sailwinged sea’.

225. sic, ‘thus', like the Greek οὕτω δὴ, sums up the previous
description. vertice poet. local abl.

226. defixit lumina regnis, ‘cast his eyes down on the kingdoms’,
regnis probably dative: the recipz'ent dat. used constantly by V. for the
prose acc. and preposition.

So descensus Averno, proiecit fluvio, pelago praecipitare, caelo educere,
truncum reliquit harenae, &a

228. oculos suffusa, “her eyes filled', for the prose oculis suffitsis. ’

V. constantly uses the acc. aster a passive participle in imitation os the
Greek. It is sometimes like the Greek middle (e. g. προβεβλημένος τήν
ἀσπίδα, ‘having put his shield before him ')‚ sometimes like the true
passive (e. g. ἐπιτετραμμένος τὴν ἀρχήν, ‘being entrusted with the govern-
ment'). Examples of the middle: os impressa thoro, tunsae pectora,
curru subjuncta leones, suspensi loculos lacerto, &c.; of the passive:
manus post terga revinctum, per pedes traiectus lora, &a So lines 320,
481.

2 3 3. ob ltaliam, ‘for Italy’s sake '‚ i. e., as the sense shews, to keep
them from Italy.

2 3 5. revocato, ‘revived'.

236. qni tenerent, final, ‘to hold’.

237. pollicitus, verb, ‘thou didst promise': so post ubi digressi,
postquam exertzpta fames 216, naves quae forte paratae. Others more
clumsily take it as participle, with the construction suddenly broken.

quae—vertit, ‘what [new] purpose has changed thee ’‚ a Vergilian
variation, instead os the simple ‘why is thy purpose changed?’

242. Antenor. The legend was, that Antenor the Trojan escaping
led a colony oi Trojans and Eneti or Heneti (from Asia Minor) to the

north end of the Adriatic, where they settled under the name of Veneti,
which still survives. See note on 1.

Achivi, see note on 30.

243. Illyricum was the country on the east coast of the Adriatic.

²44· Liburni were an Illyrian people.

Timavus, a small river at the head of the Adriatic between Trieste
and Aquileia. For the last mile os its course it sinks through fissured
limestone underground: and it is said that at times the sea comes rushing
through the limestone and floods the land above the outlets. This is
clearly what Vergil means to describe in 245—6.

247. urbem Patavi, gen. of equivalence or description. So urbs
Mycenae v. 52, flumen Himellae vll. 714, mons Cimini vn. 697,
