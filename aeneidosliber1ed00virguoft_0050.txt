46 VERGJL. AEN J.

80. gen. after potens. like Hor. Diva potens Cypri.

[St—123. Aeolus raises a storm: Aeneas in terror laments: the
fleet is scattered, some founder, some are wrecked.] -

82. impuli! montem inlatus, ‘struck against the mountain‘s side’,
a poetic variation sor the obvious montis latus which we should have in
prose. So 1 ι 5, unam [navem] in puppim ferit.

Observe the rhythm also, suggesting the shock of the sudden
impatient blow.

84. incubuere, the common perfect of rapid action, ‘they press
upon the sea’; so intonuere 90.

85. Eumcs...Nolus...Asricus‚ ‘the E. and W. and squally South'.
The two first names of the winds are Greek: Africus is the natural
Latin name of the S. wind blowing from the coast of Africa.

86. volvont, for volvunt: uu (v being written as u) was a com—
bination usually objected to in classical times.

89. incubat, ‘broods '.

90. poli, poetic plural: ‘the heavens'.

92. frigore, ‘shuddering fear': frigus, properly ‘shuddering’, then
‘cold': same stem as Greek φρίσσω, and ῥῖγος. -

94. refert, ‘utters’, as 208: with no notion of answering.

95. quis, other form of dat. sor quibus. ,

96. oppetere, properly ‘meet’ like obire, i. e. ‘death’: so simply
(also like obeo) used absolutely for ‘sall’, ‘die’.

97. Tydides, Diomedes son os Tydeus, a famous Greek who fought
Aeneas, and would have slain him but for the aid of Venus his mother.

mene...non potuisse, 37.

99. iacet, ‘fell’ historic present: (‘lies low' for ‘was laid low'). It
is better to take iacet so, and volvit perf. than to suppose (as is also
possible) Aeneas thinking of thern as still lying there. See note on ¹00.

Aeacidae, Achilles son of Peleus, son os Aeacus.

Hector, son of Priam, the great Trojan hero of the Iliad.

100. Sarpedon, prince of the Lycians, ally of Troy, slain by
Achilles' friend Patroclus. His body was taken home by his comrades,
according to Homer, but if iacet means ‘fell' there is no difficulty.

Simois, one of the famed rivers of the Troad.

102. iactanti (lit. os violent utterance), ‘bewailed‘: the dat. is used
naturally because he is the person affected.

Aquilone, ‘north-wind' : the abl. is instr.

103. velum adversa ferit, ‘strikes the sail in front’, poet. variation
for adversum: logically the adj. may be used of either.

104. avertit, ‘swings round’: in V. verto, volvo, sisto, fero, pono,
iunge, praecipito, &a are all used intrans.

105. Notice the powerful description and suggestive sound of the
line ε ‘There follows a towering eliff of water’.

cumulo, descriptive abl. ‘in a heap ’.

Others take it of the breaking, not the swelling wave: but this does
not suit the words so well.

107. harenis, abl. instr. ‘boil thick with sand 'z the sand adds to the
confusion of the seething water.

¹09· Vergil as usual embodies in his poem local and popular
