64 VERGJL. AEN. J.

569. Saturnia, because according to the legend Saturnus father of
Iuppiter came from Latium and os old in the golden age was king
there.

572. voltis et: we should say. ‘or would you ¹.

, 573. urbem quam statuo vestra est. A colloquialism due probably
to attraction. So Istum quem quaeris ego sum, Plaut. Curc. 111. 49, illum
quem ementitus es is ego sum, Trin. 985.

574. ‘Trojan or Tyrian 1 shall regard alike', a strange variation
from the natural phrase agere discrimen: just such a refinement as V.
deli hts in.

5376. certos, ‘sure messengers’.

578. eiectus, by the sea, ‘a shipwrecked man ’.

si quibus...errat‚ not ‘to see if’ as C., which would be subj. but
simply, ‘isperchance'.

[579—612. Achates asks Aeneas what to do: the cloud bursts and
reveals them. Aeneas bright as a god speaks: ‘For thy pity the gods
reward thee: thou shalt have eterna} same'. He then greets his com-
rades]

579. animum arrecti, ‘their hearts stirred', construction probably
the same as 228.

580. erumpere nubem, ‘to cleave the cloud’: variation of con-
struction from nube, on the principle of the transitive sense of the verb
acquiring the transitive construction, see 317. So excedo, exeo, egredior,
evado, dabor, eluctor all take acc. in the sense os escape, pass, avoid,
elude. &a

584. unus, Orontes, 113—117.

587. scindit se etpurgat, ‘parts and clears ’‚ both verbs being transi-
tive take se.

588. restitit, ‘There stood': the re· implying that the cloud moved
off and he remained.

591.l purpureum, apparently means ‘brighl' rather than any parti-
cular eo our.

adflarat, ‘had breathed on him’: the word is suitable to honores,
‘beauty’ and perhaps in poetry to lumen, ‘light’ but hardly to caesariem
‘clustering hair': we can only say ‘shed’ is we want n word sor all
three. This usage is called zeugma, and is usually easy to explain, as
here, by the order: see note on line 3.

592. manus, ‘the artist‘s hands'.

decus, ‘glory’: he does not explain what the setting os the ivory is:
but in x. 135, where the simile reappears very much the same, it is ‘box
wood (rich yellow-brown) or terebinth’ (dark wood).

The point of all three comparisons seems here to be more general
tha-n in the other passage (x. 135): new beauty is shed round the hero,
as the artist sets the precious ivory, silver. or marble in beautiful cases.
For the simile see Introduction, p. 12.

593. Parius lapis, the marble of Paros, an island in Aegaean sea,

S. of Delos.

598. reliquias Danaum, 30.

599. exhaustos, ‘outworn' [another reading exhaustis makes no
better sense: is less well attested: and spoils the balance of the clausel.
