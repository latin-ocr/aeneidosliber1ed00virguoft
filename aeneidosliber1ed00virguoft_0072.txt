68 VERGIL. AEN. l.

[695—722. Cupid finds the queen seated‚ the guests coming, the
servants ordering the feast. He clasps his father, then embraces and is
cherished by Dido, and begins his wiles.]

696. duce laetus Achate, ‘glad in the guidance of Achates’, the abl.
os attendant circumstances (the same thing practically as the abl. abs.)
here in close connexion with laetus.

697. aulaeis superbis, the same abl. again, ‘amid proud hangings'.

698. aurea, two syllables as often, ea having been slurred into one
(synizesis). So aureis, 726.

mediam, ‘in the midst ⁸ of the hall and the guests.

701. manibus, ‘upon their hands’, the guests'.

702. expediunt, here ‘serve’z for the phraseology see 177.

tonsis villis, ‘close-clipped nap', [villis connected with vellus, οὖλος,
Ιῒέριον, and our wool} The clothes are rich and soft.

703. quibus ordine longam cura penum struere, ‘whose task it is
duly to pile a long store os sood’, i. e. a store to last a long while:
a strange use of longa, but confirmed by a later poet (Ausou. 111. 27)
who (thinking very likely of this passage) says cui non longa penus,
lzuz‘c qnoque prompta fames.

[The MSS. all but Pal. read ordine longo, a common and easy
phrase: but we find longam also known as carly as Gellius, 150 Α. 0.]

704. adolere, a strange word with various senses. Originally ‘to
incgease’ (cf. adolescens, alere, ἃς.) used (like macto) for ‘to honour'

o s.
g Vergil uses it sor lo honour here: to qffer ad. honores 111. 547: to
burn verbenas ad. Ecl. v111. 65 τ lo fire altaria vn. 71.

706. qui with subj. final, ‘to load'.

708. pictis, ‘embroidered'‚ as osten: ‘to embroider’ is properly
pingere acu, so 711.

710. A fine effective line: ‘the god's flaming glances and seigned
words’, dei comes in well after he has called him lulum.

712. pe’slz', ‘bane', ‘ill’, ‘ruin'.

71 3. expleri mentem, quasi-middle, see above, 215³ ‘cannot sate
her soul ’.

715. complexu colloque abstract and concrete mixed, both abl.
being local ‘in the clasp and on the neck '‚ i. e. clasped on the neck. “

716. ‘filled to the full his salse sathcr’s love’.

720. matris Acidaliae, Venus, so called from a spring in Boeotia
named Aa'dalz'an, where the Graces and Venus bathed.

720—2. ‘Slowly to blot out Sychaeus, and with a living love to
surprise a soul long slumbcring and a heart unused ’.

[723—756. Dido calls sor a cup and pledgcs the strangers, the other

7y²]4. vina coronant, Vergil clearly means ‘put flou-ers round the
cups’, which the Romans did at seasts: so cratera corona induit, 111.
52 5: but he intends no doubt also to translate the common Homeric
phrase, κοῦροι δὲ κρητῆρας ἐπαστέψαντο ποτοῖο, which however simply
means ‘filled' not ‘crowned'.
