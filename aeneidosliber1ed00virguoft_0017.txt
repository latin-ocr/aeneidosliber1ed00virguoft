JNTRODUCTJON. 13

Aeneas is not much like an artist framing ivory in boxwood or
gilding marble. And in (3) we have an ext-reme case: for Dido
is going majestically to the temple surrounded with youths:
Diana is circled with a troop of nymph, and ‘plies tlte dance’ :
and has a quiver on her shoulder: and her proud mother watches
her. There is in fact no resemblance, save in the point that
both are beautiful figures advancing. In all these cases the
details are irrelevant to the comparison5 they are worked out
independently. The resemblance turns on one or two points and

those commonplace.

This is what we may call the primitive use of the simile, as it
is employed in Homer, and imitated in many poets since. There
is however a modern use of the simile which is quite different.
If we open Shelley we read

“The golden gates of Sleep unbar
Where strength and beauty, met together,
Kindle their image like a star
In a sea ofglassy weatlzerss’
Here there is nothing obvious in the comparison: we should
never have thought, without the aid of the poet's superb imagi-
nation, of comparing the union of love to a star rnirrored in the
smooth sea: and yet there is a profound appropriateness, not
only in the image, but in all the suggestions of it: the beauty,
the isolation from others, the reflection of the brilliance‚ the
infinsty, the serenity. Or again,
“Life lz'lee a dome os many-coloured glass
Staz'ns tlte white radz‘ance of Eterm'ty
Untz‘l Deatlz tramples it to fragments.’'
Here too the comparison is not at all obvious: it is fetched from
far by the poet’s deeper insight and quicker sensibility: and it
is splendidly illustrative all through: the bright colours corn-
pared with the pure white light resembling the chequered shifting
imperfect beauties of life compared with the changeless per-
fection of eternity: the narrow limited dome and the endless
vault of heaven give another equally deep contrast: and lastly,
the perishable glass contrasted with the eternal spaces of the
umverse.
