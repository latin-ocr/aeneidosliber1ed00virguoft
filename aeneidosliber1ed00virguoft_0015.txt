IN TR ODU C TI ON. 1 1

love into the hearts of Aeneas and the Queen. At length after
many questions Dido asks Aeneas to repeat to her the whole
story of his adventures.

In the second book he accordingly relates the sack of Troy
and his escape. In the third he continues the story, recounting
all his wanderings since, till he reached Africa.

Book 1V. tells of the love, desertion, despair and suicide of
the Carthaginian queen.

The fifth book is an interlude, giving an account of games
held in Sicily, whither a storm drives them, on their way from
Carthage to Italy. At last however Aeneas departs‚ leaving the
weak and half-hearted behind, and reaches the promised land.

One of the most effective portions of the Aeneid is his
descent to Hades by the lake of Avernus near Naples, where
he meets his dead father, Anchises, who shews him the souls of
the future great men of Rome. He then emerges from the
realms below and rejoins his fleet.

Reaching at length the coast of Latinum, he discovers by a
sign that this is his fated home. He sends to the king Latinus
to offer peace, which is at first agreed to, and Aeneas is betrothed
to Lavinia, daughter of the king; but difficulties arise, the gods
interfere, and Turnus, king of the Rutules, who is a suitor of
Lavinia, induces Latinus to join him in war against the
Trojans.

Aeneas meanwhile sails up the Tiber, and makes alliance
with the Arcadian Euander, who is king of a small tribe on the
site of the future Rome.

Euander advises him to seek aid from the Etruscans of
Caere, which he does. The war is begun. After much blood-
shed, in which Pallas son of Euander, and the terrible Tuscan
king Mezentius, are slain, it is at last agreed that the issue shall
be decided by single combat between Aeneas and Turnus.
Iuno tries to interfere; but at length the heroes meet, and
Aeneas grapples and slays Turnus.
