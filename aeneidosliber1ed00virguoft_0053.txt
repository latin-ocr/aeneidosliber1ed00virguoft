NOTES. 49

ιἔ67. vivo, ‘living’ rock, i. e. not artificially built, but the natural
roc .

173. tabentes, ‘drenched'z usually of the weltering of decay.

17 5. succepit, old form of the verb suscepit and so preferred by V.
with his antiquarian tendencies.

alque arirla..flanmtam, ‘and heaped dry fuel round and sanned the
flame amid the tinder'‚ the fuel and sinder being merely varied ex-
pressions for the dry leaves and chips and twigs.

rapuit, ‘snatched‘‚ ‘hui-siml along’, a rather out of the way word for
‘sanned', which is what he means.

177. Cererem corrzsptam...arma‚ ‘corn spoiled by the sea and
implements for bread': only the poet, speaking of homely things, tries
to dignify thern by the stately expressions, Cererem (the goddess in-
ventor os corn, used for her gifts, like Bacchus), and Cerealia arma
(for kneading-trough, mill, &c.). So again VII. 112, where bread is
called adorea liba, Cereale solum, orbis fatalis crusti: so below 702
Cererem canistris mpediunt.

178. sessi rerum, ‘weary of trouble', rerum, a vague wide word,
effective from its very vagueness. Cf. sunl lacrimae rerum, ‘tears sor
trouble’. discrimina rerum, ‘perils and troubles’.

The gen. is the gen. of reference, so common in Gk. after adj. and
frequent in Augustan poets: certus salutis, trepidae rerum, fida lui,
securus pelagi, διο.

rcrcplas, ‘rescued ’.

[180—207. Aeneas climbs a hill to see if he can descry his lost
friends, but in vain. Meeting a herd of deer he kills seven, one sor
each ]ship, and distributes wine, and consoles them with hope of better
da s.

y181. prospectum lale pelago petil, (observe the alliteration), ‘all the
wide sea-view he scans’. pelago, abl. local, common in V. like allo
prospiciens, 1²6.

si quem, pronoun used by a license adverbially‚ see note on 8,
‘if anywhere’. So English colloquially: ¹1 went to find Smith, but no
Smith was to be found ’.

Observe ‘if’ used here for ‘to see if' just as εἰ and ἣν are in Greek:
and indeed as is natural in any language with the word if.

183. Caicus would be the chief man on board his ship, and so his
shield would be suspended at the stern, according to the sashion
described Vin. 92 fitlgentz'a longe scuta virum fluvio, &a

¹89· alta, bold and graphic word, ‘bearing their heads high with
branching antlers'.

190. volgus, ‘the common sort '.

191. miscet, ‘routs’‚ see note on ¹²4·

192. nec prius absistit quam...fnndal. The subjunctive after prius-
quam always expresses purpose. This is why in ‘1 will not do it
till...’ the second verb would generally be subjunctive, ‘We did not do
it till...’ usually indicative3 as the former expresses the intention of
waiting till, the latter merely the sequence of events.

Here the poet, by an intentional variation uses the first construction
in the second case: he wishes to express Aeneas’ resolve not to stop till
