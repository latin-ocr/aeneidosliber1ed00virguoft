NOTES. 65

600. socias, lit. ‘dost associate’ (us to thee): i.e. ‘givest us a

2
Shargbi. opis, ‘power’: the gen. of this word is rare: the acc. being the

only case of sing. used commonly, and that usually means ‘help‘.

nec quidquid, &⁴a, [neither in the power of us,] nor os all the Trojan
race that anywhere are lest, &c.

633—5. Notice the peculiar Vergilian quality of these lines: quite
simple, yet so noble and beautiful and touching.

607—8. dum montibus—pascet, ‘while the shadows shall sweep
over the mountain-slopes and the stars find pasture in the sky'.

'Vergil has no doubt in his mind Lucretius’ phrase ‘aether sidera
pascit’ where he explains that the fires of the stars are fed by the aether:
but the sugge.›lton of the phrase to the reader is the fine imaginative

comparison of the stars to a scattered flock.

611. Ilioneo, like βασιλῆα, Πηλῆα, the older form of Greek acc.

61 τ. fhrtemqtce..sortentqzce‚ soi-mula as before, 220. ,

[613—642. Dido replies: she had seen Teucer, and known and
followed the tale of Troy. She welcomes thern in, and feasts them
with royal banquet.]

616. immanibus [in- manis, old adj.= ‘good', cf. Manes, ‘the
Good’ euphemistic term for the dead]‚ ‘cruel’, ‘savage ' ε because of the
African savage tribes.

617. Dardanio Anchisae, hiatus, 494.

619. Teucer, a Greek [to be caresully distinguished from Teucer
mythical founder of the Trojans, 38]‚ son of Telamon king of Salamis,
on his return from Troy was driven out by his father and took refuge
with Belus king of Sidon (Dido‘s father) : with his aid Teucer settled in
Cyprus, founding a new Salamis there.

Sidona, Greek acc.

Observe Belus (Bel, Baal) a Semitic name.

memini, by regular idiom is used with pres. inf. of things of which
the person was a witness: e.g. memini Catonern disserere, Cic. Am. 3.
d 623. casus, ‘the fate': she uses purposely a vague word out of

elica .

62?-v Pelasgi, used for ‘Greek' simply: the Greek poets call Argos
Pelasgia. The real Pelasgi were an old race widely scattered through
Greece, of which in historic times only a few isolated remnants were left.

625. ferebat, lit. ‘spoke of'‚ i.e. ‘extolled'.

626. volebat, lit. ‘would have himself’, i.e. ‘made himself out ²,
‘boasted himself' like the well-known Homeric phrase εὔχομαι εἶναι.

630. Another beautiful line, shewing the tenderness and melancholy
characteristic os the poet.

632. ‘appoints a sacrifice for the shrines of the Gods' ; honos 49.

636. munera laetitiamque dii, ‘gifts for the sestal day'; lit. ‘gifts
and gladness of the day '‚ dii being old form for dies.

[Most of the MSS. have dei: which is understood to mean ‘gists and
joy of the God’ Bacchus: but the words go very much better as appo-
sition (abstract words with the foregoing concretes) ε the sense given, as
a phrase for ‘wine', is very harsh and obscure as no god is named: and
the reading dii is supported by Gellius, scholar of the second century]
