NOTES

The first four lines which are printed in italics occur in a few MSS„
and may be translated as follows :—

‘1 am he, who once tuned my song on the slender reed, and
leaving the woodland constrained the neighbouring fields to serve the
husbandman, though greedy of gain—a task pleasing to farmers: but
now I sing tlie dread arms of Mars and the man, &c.' 3 i. e., Ι once made
pastoral poetry (Eclogues), then leaving that I next sang the fields
(Georgics)‚ now an Epic of war (Aeneid).

But the lines are clearly not genuine. They are in no good MS.
and have only been restored from Servius, who quotes them.

Ovid, Martial and Persius all quote ‘ Arma virumque’ as the begin·
ning os the Aeneid. G. suggests that Vergil wrote thern and sent them
to a friend, without meaning them to be part of the book: and this
would explain Servius' story that Tucca and Varius, the scholars
whom Augustus ordered to edit the Aeneid after Vergil's death,
rejected the lines. Anyhow we cannot accept them.

[1—11.on›lzutt]

1. Observe the emphasis m the first sentence on the leading points
of the poem. Anna: a w-ar epic: virum, the hero Aeneas: stultam,
the national poem glorifying his beloved land· fato, the destiny of the
people: Romae, the capital and centre of all.

primus, ‘firstss The commentators are exercised because (24 2) An-
tenor is said to have settled previously at padua. But (ι) Antenoris
insignifieant: (2) Padua' is in Cisalpine Gaul, not Italy, as the Romans
named it.

2. sato profugus together, ‘by sate exiled'.

Lavinaque, i. e. Latin, from Lavinium, old town in Latium, 8 miles
from the sea. [Laviniaque‚ other reading, is the commonet form of the
adj. and can be scanned by slurring the i into a kind of y· —sound‚ like
ρᾶνίέίὲ, (ibim, but such a license is unlikely so early in the poem]
